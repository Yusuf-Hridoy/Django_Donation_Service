                                beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
                                that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue and equal blame

                                frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
                                man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
